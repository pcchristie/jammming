# Jammming: A Codecademy Project

This project is a Codecademy project designed to practice creating a web app. It helped me practice the following skills:
* Programming a Single Page App (SPA) in React (/JS)
* Use of APIs to send and receive information (in this case, from Spotify)
* Developing fully locally in an IDE (as opposed to Codecademy's web console)

## How to Use

1. Log in to Spotify using the Login button
2. Search for some songs
3. Click "Add" to add the songs you like to your new playlist.
4. Name your playlist
5. Create your playlist to push it into your Spotify account.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
